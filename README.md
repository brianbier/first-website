## Summary
I am a full stack developer who believes in simplicity, innovation, and creativity when designing and building web applications.
I built my site using a responsive design starting from smaller screens to larger screens. This made the design of the website easier to build for phones and tablets. As much as I like to use frameworks, I decided to build my site without a framework to test my knowledge of HTML5 semantics, CSS styling, and Javascript.  

## Technologies
* Html5
* CSS
* Javascript
