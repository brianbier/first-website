  <h2 class="sub-title">A bucket of Arrays and Hashes
  </h2>
  <p>Programming is fun and making a career out of it can change your life forever. These are a few words that you find on the web about programming but what no one tells you is that programming is very difficult. The great news is that everything in life is difficult at first but with practice and dedication, you soon realize nothing is impossible. This is week 4 of my journey at Dev Bootcamp and we focus on learning the basics of Ruby most importantly Arrays and Hashes. Today I will try and explain the concepts of Arrays and Hashes to the best of my ability so that it is easier for you to learn. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The first thing I can say is that both arrays and hashes are used to store and retrieve data or information. You can think of arrays as a list of objects inside in sequential order. They are wrap in square brackets and can contain strings, numbers, other arrays, and hashes.<br>
<strong>Example of Array:</strong>
  </p>
  <pre class= "ruby-code-snippet">grocery_list = [“milk”,”eggs”,”coffee”,”cookies”,”bagels”,[”cream cheese”]]
  </pre>
  <p>
     With the array above you can look up pieces of data by calling the array and the index number associated. Remember computers start counting from zero. So lets say you need to get items from the grocery store and you want to know what is the first item in the grocery_list array you have to type in your console<strong> grocery_list[0]</strong> which gives you <strong>“milk”</strong> and <strong>grocery_list[1] </strong> gives you <strong>“eggs”</strong> and so on until there aren't any more items to call in your array. Another neat trick is calling an array backward like <strong>grocery_list[-1]</strong> will give you <strong>[“cream cheese”]</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hashes in the other hand are collections with key-value pairs of information. Each set of pairs has a unique key and value that it is associated with that key. It is important that you use unique keys if you try using the same key ruby will give you an error message warning you about what you are trying to do.<br>
<strong>Example of Hash:</strong></p>
<pre class="ruby-code-snippet">
grocery_list = { 
“milk” => “organic milk”, 
“eggs” => “organic eggs”, 
“cookies” => “oreo”, 
“bagels” => “sesame bagel”,
”cream cheese” => “strawberry flavor” }

</pre>
  <p>As you can see a hash is more of a detail list that contain specific information in the values of each key wrapped in curly braces. Hash can be better imagined as tables. So if you go back to the grocery store you check your hash and you see you need milk but it has to be a specific kind of milk.  In order to call a hash, you must type in your console the name of the hash and the key in order to retrieve the value <strong>grocery_list[“milk”]</strong> will give you <strong>“organic milk” </strong>and <strong>grocery_list[“sesame bagel”]</strong> will give you<strong> “strawberry flavor”.</strong> In Python hashes are called dictionaries which kind of makes more sense because essentially a key = the word and the value = the definition of the word. I hope that makes sense. As far as which is better it depends on your preference and what you are planning to do. You need to determine which functions better in your program and hopefully, the concept above help you determine that distinction. 
</p>
<p>
  My final though is that base on performance hashes are faster in ruby compare to arrays. I would prefer using an array to hold simple content for later use in my program and a hash for when I am storing detail content. I hope this helps you understand the differences with array and hashes. They will become very useful further down your path of web development.<strong class="blog-slogan"> Good Luck out there and like always keep on Coding.</strong>
