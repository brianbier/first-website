  <p>After many hours of reading and typing all those HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) elements, I can finally say that I am the master of HTML(J/K). Yes! I know that knowing HTML is not a big deal but being that itâ€™s the first language that you learn, it makes it a very big deal. If you are feeling lucky and want to jump straight into HTML I recommend the following free online resources <a class="links-in-text" href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>,<a class="links-in-text" href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank"> W3school</a>, and <a class="links-in-text" href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>. Although free online resources are great they can get depleted very quick so I also recommend the following book; <a class="links-in-text" href="http://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189"> HTML and CSS Design and Build Websites by Jon Duckett</a> (I can lend you a copy if you simply ask). The book goes straight to the point and does not beat around the bush. There are tons of images and examples that you can play around with and it also touches on important topics like Search Engine Optimization (SEO). One advice I can give you for HTML is that it does not look pretty, but there is a solution to that and it's called Cascading style sheet (CSS).
  </p>
  <p>
   CSS is like the toppings of a pizza and in this case, the dough is the HTML. They need each other in order to make something look, feel, and taste amazing. All the resources above will have information on CSS and it is not difficult to understand. I did, however; want to explain a specific topic that I found confusing and I hope that this blog helps clarify it. In CSS, there is a property that can be used to layout the design of your HTML elements. The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an HTML element such as <strong>static, relative, fixed and absolute.</strong> </p>

  <p>
  <strong>Static</strong> position elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left and right properties. Which means that it will always position itself according to the normal flow of the website. Check out the following link, which shows you an example of what a static property means. 
  <br><strong>Test: You can test it by typing left:50% within the style section and see how nothing happens.<br><a class="position-properties" href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_position_static">Static Example</a></strong>

  </p>
  <p>
     <strong>Relative</strong> will position anything relative to its normal position. Which means you have the ability to change the top, right, bottom, and left properties of an element. This will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element. Check out the link below: <br><strong>Test: You can test it by typing left:50% bottom: 50% within the style section and see how it changes.<br><a class="position-properties" href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_position_relative">Relative Example</a></strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Fixed</strong> positioned means that it will always stay in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element. The great feature about the fixed positioning is that it does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located. Check out the link below: <br><strong>Test: You can test it by changing the left, bottom, right properties within the style section. Also, change the height and see what happens. This can be useful when creating a footer to make it stay at the bottom.<br><a class="position-properties" href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_position_fixed">Fixed Example</a></strong>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Absolute</strong> position can be moved anywhere in the website. If an absolute positioned element has nothing to lean on, it uses the documents body and moves along with page scrolling. This property is the easiest to manipulate. Check out the link below: <br><strong>Test: Change the top, bottom, and right properties and see what happens. Also, check out the layout of the divs to help you better understand how you can manipulate it.<br><a class="position-properties" href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_position_absolute">Absolute Example</a></strong>
</p>
  <p>I hope this helps your understand the positioning topics. They will become very useful further down your path of web development.<strong class="blog-slogan"> Good Luck out there and like always keep on Coding.</strong>
