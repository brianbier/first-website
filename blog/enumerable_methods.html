  </h2>
  <p>Enumerables, Enumerables, Enumerables, I have to say that I had a hard time saying this word and trying to understand what it means was just as difficult. The ruby documentation is great but when I read their definition of an Enumerable it made my head spin. Here is the ruby-doc definition “The enumeral mixin provides collection classes with several traversal and searching methods, and with the ability to sort. The class must provide a method each, which yields successive members of the collection. If Enumerable#max, #min, or #sort is used, the objects in the collection must also implement a meaningful <=> operator as these methods rely on an ordering between members of the collection.” Now if you understand what that means this blog is not for you.  If you don’t, like myself keep reading and I will try to decipher the meaning in my own simple words.
  </p>
  <p>
 Enumerable to my understanding are Ruby ways of saying that we can get elements out of a collection, one at a time. So if you are still writing loops, STOP! We just found a better way. <br>
<strong>Here is an example of taking an array of integers and creating groups within that array:</strong>
  </p>
  <pre class= "ruby-code-snippet">Example #1: using .slice_method
Number =[1, 2, 3,4]

number.each_slice(2){ |group| p group }
#=> [1,2],[3,4]


Example #2: using .map
number.map { |i| i*2 }  
#=> [1,4,9,16]
  </pre>
  <p>
     The .each_slice method saves time when you are trying to figure out how to group multiple elements in an array. The .map method is very similar to an each method since it iterates through every element in the array and applies a set condition to each element. Now you are wondering why should I use .map when I already know the each method. Well, the reason is that when you use map it creates an enumerator in which allows us to chain operations indefinitely to make heavy-duty collections.
  </p>
  <p>
<strong>Here is an example of a heavy-duty collection</strong></p>
<pre class="ruby-code-snippet">
For example #3 
Number.map 
#=>#< Enumerator:[1,2,3,4]:map >

Now it allows me to call other methods:
Number.each_slice(2)
#=>#< Enumerator:[1,2,3,4]:map>:each_slice(2) >

</pre>
  <p>Every class can use an enumerable but they each have their own methods. For example, the array methods are not identical to set methods and range methods are not identical to hash methods. Sometimes the collection classes can share method names but the methods don’t exactly do the same thing. 
</p>
<p>
  My final though is that base on performance hashes are faster in ruby compare to arrays. I would prefer using an array to hold simple content for later use in my program and a hash for when I am storing detail content. I hope this helps you understand the differences with array and hashes. They will become very useful further down your path of web development. Good Luck out there and like always keep on Coding.
  All these Enumerables seem to help in their own way. The key to its successful usage is to know when to implement it rather than standard iteration. To be honest, I am not yet fully confident on Enumerables but with constant practice that will soon change. I am sure that in the coming weeks I will become more attune to the capabilities of Enumerables as I encounter more complex data structure and iteration tasks. <strong class="blog-slogan"> Good Luck out there and like always keep on Coding.</strong>
