1. How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was great creating a wireframe with a pair because we both provide input as to how the page would look. We each had our own ideas and when we combined them it came out great. This challenge was great because we could each take turns in driving and navigating. I was the driver when creating the wireframe and my partner was the driver when creating the HTML page. We both were able to practice each role.

2. Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

I never thought wireframing would be useful because if I was the developer/designer I should have a good understanding of my idea and how I wanted it to look. However, wireframing will help me see flaws faster and see how it would look visually. Sometimes the mind can play tricks on you and not see the flaws. Wireframing helps when you pair with bigger teams, since everyone will have the ability to see the end result and stay within the scope.

3. What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

We both agreed that having a good wireframing tool makes a big difference because you can create a wireframes faster and more precise. Also when making a good wireframe it is best to be organize and detail with what you want because you canâ€™t add animations to the wireframe, so you want the developer to know what is it that you want.

4. What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I did not learn any new semantic elements for this challenge.
